## **About the Project**

Wordle Native is a fun and simple mobile game where players try to guess a hidden word in a limited number of attempts. This project was built using React Native, providing a great introduction to developing mobile apps using Expo.

## **Installation**

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/wordle-native.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wordle-native
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the project on an Android device or emulator:

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

## **Usage**

After installation, the game can be played on your device by following the Expo instructions on how to build and run the app. You cannot use Expo Go to preview the app because React MMKV needed to be run on native device.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Expo**: For development and building the React Native app.
- **React Native Reanimated**: For smooth animations and transitions.
- **React Navigation**: For easy and intuitive navigation between screens.
- **React MMKV**: For high-performance storage and state management.
- **Nativewind**: For using Tailwind CSS-style utility classes in React Native.
